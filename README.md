# Playlistify

Manage your spotify (or compatible) playlists directly from your console.

## About

This is a solution for [this coding challenge](https://gist.github.com/vitchell/a081703591116bab7e859cc000c98495)
powered by Ruby v3.

## Project Requirements

### Application

The input JSON file consists of a set of `users`, `songs`, and `playlists`
that are part of an online music service: [spotify.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vitchell/fe0b1cb51e158058fb1b9d827584d01f/raw/f00f4d94d9d87b0d928bb3766a2667fb502d7407/spotify.json).

- [ ] Ingests `spotify.json`
- [ ] Ingests a `changes file`, which can take whatever form you like (we use
  `changes.json` in our example, but you’re free to name it whatever, and format
  it as text, YAML, CSV, or whatever)
- [ ] Outputs `output.json` in the same structure as `spotify.json`, with the
  changes applied. The types of changes you need to support are enumerated below

### Features
- [ ] Add an existing song to an existing playlist
- [ ] Add a new playlist for an existing user; the playlist should contain at
  least one existing song
- [ ] Remove an existing playlist

### README.md
- [ ] Explains how to use your application and a way to validate its output
- [ ] Describes what changes you would need to make in order to scale this
  application to handle very large input files and/or very large changes files.
  Just describe these changes — please do not implement a scaled-up version of
  the application.
- [ ] Includes any thoughts on design decisions you made that you think are
  appropriate.
- [ ] Includes how long you spent on the project, and any other thoughts you
  might have or want to communicate.

### Notes
- Don’t worry about creating a UI, DB, server, or deployment as a part of the
  code you're writing.
- Your code should be executable on Mac or Linux.

### My notes

- [ ] Make the script executable and add instructions on how to run it

## How do I use this?

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to clone it and submit a
pull request. I'll be happy to review it and merge it if it's good to go.
Following subsections will help you setup the project and run the tests.

### Setup

This is a simple Ruby project, so you just need to install the dependencies
and you're good to go.

```shell
bundle install
```

### Testing

If you want to run the tests, you can do so by running `rspec` in the root.

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

## Problem Solving Walkthrough

### Entities relationships and attributes
The first thing I did was analyzing the `spotify.json` file and created
a [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagram to visualize the
relationships between the entities. This project consists of 3 entities: `User`,
`Song`, and `Playlist`. And the relationships between them are as follows:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Playlist : has
    Song ||--o{ Playlist : has
```

As for their class diagram and attributes, I came up with the following:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  Playlist *-- User
  Playlist *-- Song
    class User {
      +String id
      +String name
    }
    class Playlist {
      +String id
      +String owner_id
      +List~String~ song_ids
    }
    class Song {
      +String id
      +String artist
      +String title
    }
```

With that, I need to keep in mind that we want to achieve the following:
- **Add an existing song to an existing playlist**
  - That is, add `song_id` to a `Playlist.song_ids` list
- **Add a new playlist for an existing user**
  -  In other words, create a new `Playlist` with existing user as `owner_id`
- Remove an existing playlist
  - Simply put, remove a `Playlist` from the output file
