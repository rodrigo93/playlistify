# Playlistify

Manage your spotify (or compatible) playlists directly from your console.

## About

This is a solution for [this coding challenge](https://gist.github.com/vitchell/a081703591116bab7e859cc000c98495)
powered by Ruby v3.

## Project Requirements

### Application

The input JSON file consists of a set of `users`, `songs`, and `playlists`
that are part of an online music service: [spotify.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/vitchell/fe0b1cb51e158058fb1b9d827584d01f/raw/f00f4d94d9d87b0d928bb3766a2667fb502d7407/spotify.json).

- [x] Ingests `spotify.json`
- [x] Ingests a `changes file`, which can take whatever form you like (we use
  `changes.json` in our example, but you‚Äôre free to name it whatever, and format
  it as text, YAML, CSV, or whatever)
- [x] Outputs `output.json` in the same structure as `spotify.json`, with the
  changes applied. The types of changes you need to support are enumerated below

### Features
- [x] Add an existing song to an existing playlist
- [] Add a new playlist for an existing user; the playlist should contain at
  least one **existing** song
- [x] Remove an existing playlist

### README.md
- [ ] Explains how to use your application and a way to validate its output
- [ ] Describes what changes you would need to make in order to scale this
  application to handle very large input files and/or very large changes files.
  Just describe these changes ‚Äî please do not implement a scaled-up version of
  the application.
- [ ] Includes any thoughts on design decisions you made that you think are
  appropriate.
- [ ] Includes how long you spent on the project, and any other thoughts you
  might have or want to communicate.

### Notes
- Don‚Äôt worry about creating a UI, DB, server, or deployment as a part of the
  code you're writing.
- Your code should be executable on Mac or Linux.

### My notes

- [ ] Make the script executable and add instructions on how to run it

## How do I use this?

### Installation

To run this project you need to have Ruby v3 installed. If you don't have it
installed, you can follow [this guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

### Usage

To use this application, open a terminal in the root of this project, then you
need to run it with a command with the following format:

```shell
ruby main.rb <input_file>.json <changes_file>.json <output_file>.json
```

E.g
```shell
ruby main.rb ./samples/spotify.json samples/changes.json samples/output.json
`````
### `changes.json` file

The `changes.json` file is a JSON file that contains a list of changes that we
want to apply to the `spotify.json` file. It's an array of objects with the
following format (all fields are required):

```json
[
  {
    "action": "add_song_to_playlist",
    "data": {
      "playlist_id": "1",
      "song_id": "5"
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "add_playlist_to_user",
    "data": {
      "user_id": "2",
      "playlist": {
        "id": "5",
        "owner_id": "2",
        "song_ids": ["2", "3", "4"]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "remove_playlist",
    "data": {
      "playlist_id": "3"
    }
  }
]
```

> **The changes will be applied in the order they are in the file!**

#### Actions

The `action` field can have one of the following values:
- `add_song_to_playlist`
- `add_playlist_to_user`
- `remove_playlist`

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to clone it and submit a
pull request. I'll be happy to review it and merge it if it's good to go.
Following subsections will help you setup the project and run the tests.

### Setup

This is a simple Ruby project, so you just need to install the dependencies
and you're good to go.

```shell
bundle install
```

### Testing

If you want to run the tests, you can do so by running `rspec` in the root.

```shell
bundle exec rspec
```

## Problem Solving Walkthrough üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Entities relationships and attributes üîó
The first thing I did was analyzing the `spotify.json` file and created
a [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagram to visualize the
relationships between the entities. This project consists of 3 entities: `User`,
`Song`, and `Playlist`. And the relationships between them are as follows:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Playlist : has
    Song ||--o{ Playlist : has
```

As for their class diagram and attributes, I came up with the following:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  Playlist *-- User
  Playlist *-- Song
    class User {
      +String id
      +String name
    }
    class Playlist {
      +String id
      +String owner_id
      +List~String~ song_ids
    }
    class Song {
      +String id
      +String artist
      +String title
    }
```

With that, I need to keep in mind that we want to achieve the following:
- **Add an existing song to an existing playlist**
  - That is, add `song_id` to a `Playlist.song_ids` list
- **Add a new playlist for an existing user**
  -  In other words, create a new `Playlist` with existing user as `owner_id`
- Remove an existing playlist
  - Simply put, remove a `Playlist` from the output file

Cool! But how will we achieve that with the `changes` file? ü§î

Let's think about that.

### The `changes` file üë∫

The `changes` file is a JSON file that contains a list of changes that we want
to apply to the `spotify.json` file. It looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "add_song",
    "playlist_id": "1",
    "song_id": "42"
  },
  {
    "action": "add_playlist",
    "playlist": {
      "id": "4",
      "owner_id": "3",
      "song_ids": ["6", "8", "11"]
    }
  },
  {
    "action": "remove_playlist",
    "playlist_id": "2"
  }
]
```

I decided to go with JSON as it's a simple format and it's easy to parse. Also,
it's a common format used in the web, so it's a good choice for this project.

The changes will be applied in the order they are in the file, so we need to
keep that in mind.

Also we talk about `change`, `change`, and `change`. So sounds like it makes
sense to create a `Change` class to represent a change.
